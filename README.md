## About me 🙋‍♀️

I am a person who loves doing new stuff and learning, I can't stop researching and practising what I learn, or even challenging myself to do things that I might fear. I can work both alone and as part of a team. I am a very social person.

I am really interested in _cultural differences_.

```python
